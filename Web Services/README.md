**news-asset-factories.php**

Building on **test-asset-factory.php**, this script changes the placement folder of multiple asset factory objects. In this example, I am automating the [monthly maintenance tasks](https://github.com/espanae/Cascade-News/wiki/Maintenance) for our News site.

**Updated May 23, 2014:** Wing has added Asset Factory [recipes] (http://www.upstate.edu/cascade-admin/projects/web-services/oop/recipes/asset-factory-recipes.php).
